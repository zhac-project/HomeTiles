# HomeTiles architecture and maintenance guide

This contributor guide explains ownership boundaries and remaining maintenance
work. See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for rules, [PROJECT_CONTEXT.md](PROJECT_CONTEXT.md)
for current validation and [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md) for build/release procedures.

The priority is stable, responsive firmware; refactoring should clarify
ownership and make behavior easier to test or extend.

## Subsystem map

| Area | Primary implementation | Responsibility and boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Application orchestration | `HomeTiles.ino` | Startup, operating modes, pending actions, service ordering, LVGL cadence |

| Icons | `src/tiles/icons/` | MDI lookup and icon data shared by tile types |
| Folder presentation | `src/ui/tabs/tiles/tab_tiles_unified.*` | Active grid, cached folders, navigation, reloads and cached-state dispatch |
| Device UI | `src/ui/tabs/settings/`, `src/ui/shared/`, `src/ui/ui_manager.*` | Settings controls, common keyboard/surfaces and screen coordination |
| Popups | `src/ui/popups/<type>/`, `src/ui/popups/popup_layout.h` | Reusable UI objects, interactions, pending responses and local lifecycle |

| MQTT | `src/network/mqtt/` | Packet safety, inbound topic routing, state queues and application commands |
| Bridge integration | `src/network/bridge/` | Entity metadata, Bridge configuration, indexes and device entity IDs |
| Camera | `src/video/camera_stream.*`, `src/ui/popups/camera/camera_popup.*` | Network/JPEG worker, frame ownership and loop-side presentation |
| Web server | `src/web/server/` | Server lifecycle/routes; `handlers/` owns endpoints, `render/` builds pages, `assets/` serves embedded resources |
| Initial web setup | `src/web/setup/` | Setup/AP configuration, separate from normal Web Admin |
| Browser editor | `src/web/admin/`, `src/types/*/admin*.js` | Drafts, previews, autosave and type-specific browser behavior; generated output stays in `src/web/assets/` |
| Firmware update | `src/core/firmware/`, `src/web/server/handlers/web_admin_ota.cpp` | Image identity, versioning, download/staging, flash writes and recovery |
| Localization | `src/core/i18n/i18n.*` | Shared device/Web Admin strings and language-dependent formatting |
| Build metadata | `tools/device-profiles.json`, `tools/device-catalog.js` | Build, release, silicon and installer identity outside the firmware runtime |
| Host verification | `tools/tests/<area>/`, `tools/lib/`, `tools/fixtures/` | Domain tests, shared harness code and independent compatibility fixtures |

The subfolders group related code by responsibility across the whole project,
so hardware, storage, UI, network and HTTP work use the same navigation pattern.
Paired headers and implementations remain together. Domain code stays with its
owner: type records belong in `src/types/`, popup lifecycle in `src/ui/popups/`,
and an exact-board SDIO workaround in that board's `src/devices/` directory.
Folders do not create new runtime services or justify changing service order.
Build/generation entry points remain directly under `tools/`; tests are grouped
by `build`, `core`, `devices`, `network`, `tiles` and `web` beneath `tools/tests/`.

Dependencies are not yet one-way: rendering reads configuration/Bridge metadata,
network recovery knows camera activity, and popup opening knows peer popups.

## Source size versus responsibility

Generated fonts and compressed Web assets, icon mappings, logo pixel data and
vendor touch-controller firmware tables contain substantial compiled data.
Splitting that data does not simplify application behavior. Handwritten hotspots
include `tile_renderer.cpp`, `tile_config.cpp`, `tab_tiles_unified.cpp`,
`mqtt_handlers.cpp`, the large popups and HTTP handlers. Their parsing, storage,
networking and presentation responsibilities are the useful extraction targets.

## Data flow and thread ownership

The Arduino loop owns LVGL and normal application state mutation. It handles
deferred HTTP/UI actions, consumes inbound MQTT, updates caches and widgets,
and services `lv_timer_handler()`. Active, sleep, AP and OTA modes deliberately
have different service policies.

The MQTT worker owns the MQTT client and socket. Its receive callback validates
and copies messages into a bounded queue of pointers, preferring PSRAM for
payload storage. The loop drains that queue and runs application topic handlers.
Moving socket work off the loop does not authorize moving LVGL or flash mutation
onto that worker.

The normal state path is:

```text
Home Assistant / Bridge -> MQTT worker -> inbound queue -> loop topic handler
  -> entity metadata/state cache -> type update queue -> widget state -> LVGL
```

Device interactions and browser changes take different paths:

```text
Device control -> validated command -> outbound queue -> MQTT worker -> Bridge
Browser editor -> draft/autosave -> HTTP handler -> persistence -> pending reload
  -> loop grid/cache refresh -> device rendering and browser preview
```

Outbound MQTT has separate control, normal-publish and large-publish lanes.
Startup bursts, buffer growth and P4 DMA headroom affect their scheduling.
Recovery waits for camera socket ownership to end before tearing down transport.
These restrictions are stability mechanisms, not general-purpose task scheduling.

### Topic transports (ZHAC fork)

The worker's `mqtt_client` is a `SelectedTopicClient` (`src/network/topic_client.h`)
that forwards to the transport chosen by the `transport` setting; the queues,
lanes and call sites above are the same for both:

| Transport | Class | Wire |
|---|---|---|
| `mqtt` (default) | `PubSubClientAdapter` | the vendored PubSubClient to an MQTT broker, unchanged |
| `cloud` | `CloudTopicClient` (`src/network/cloud/`) | one WebSocket to ZHAC Cloud, subprotocol `hometiles.v1`, `Authorization: Bearer <panel token>` |

`hometiles.v1` sends one operation per binary message: op byte (`0x01` PUB,
`0x02` SUB, `0x03` UNSUB, `0x04` WILL, `0x7F` ERR from the cloud), flags byte
(bit 0 retain), topic length (uint16 big-endian, 1-1024), topic, payload (at
most 65,535 bytes). The codec in `cloud_frame.h` is pure and host-tested. The
cloud client is polled by the worker like PubSubClient: `connect()` blocks up
to 15 s for TCP, TLS and the HTTP upgrade, then registers the last will;
received PUB frames reach the callback on the worker. The server certificate is
verified against ESP-IDF's common-CA bundle (`cloud_ca_bundle.cpp`, generated by
`tools/generate-cloud-ca-bundle.py`); it defines the bundle symbols itself
because the core's full 69 KB Mozilla bundle does not fit the Tab5 app slot. HTTP 401/402/403 at the handshake and close codes 1008
(token revoked) / 4402 (plan required) are refusals: the worker waits 15
minutes instead of 6-96 s and the Web Admin shows the reason. The panel token
(`cloud_token`) is write-only. The WebSocket library is a patched, vendored
client subset of arduinoWebSockets 2.7.2 (LGPL-2.1, see its README).

The same socket carries the remote Web Admin tunnel (`cloud_tunnel.h`; ops
`0x10` TUN_OPEN, `0x11` TUN_DATA, `0x12` TUN_CLOSE, the topic is the stream
id), announced with `X-HomeTiles-Features: tunnel` at the handshake. Each
stream is one raw HTTP/1.1 request that the worker bridges to the panel's own
Web Admin at `127.0.0.1:80`, so the handlers stay unchanged. At most two
streams; the worker reads the loopback socket eagerly into PSRAM (at most
256 KiB per stream) so the web server, which writes from the loop, is never
held up by the internet link, and sends at most one 16 KiB TUN_DATA frame per
stream and pass so tile states interleave. A stream ends with TUN_CLOSE `done`
after the response, `busy`, `refused`, `timeout` (30 s idle) or `error`; a
dropped cloud socket closes every stream.

The media artwork worker owns HTTP download buffers and unpublished results.
The loop attaches image descriptors to widgets and performs LVGL cache cleanup.
Freeing an unpublished descriptor differs from releasing an image already used
by LVGL; an extraction must preserve that distinction.

Camera buffers have protected `Free`, `Writing`, `Ready`, `Presenting` and
`Displayed` states. The worker cannot overwrite a displayed/presenting buffer.
Closing a camera removes LVGL's image reference before requesting worker cleanup;
draw-buffer restoration is deferred outside the LVGL callback.

## Changes implemented in this refactoring

### One device catalog for host tooling

`tools/device-profiles.json` defines build names, device keys, exact silicon
ranges, transport variants, linker requirements and release/installer metadata.
`tools/device-catalog.js` validates those relationships before exposing them to
the local builder, importer and packager.

`tools/generate-device-profiles.mjs` generates the marked CI matrix and
`docs/assets/javascripts/device-profiles.mjs`. The installer consumes that output.
`release-helper/firmware-metadata.js` supplies shared image identity validation
for host-side packaging and size comparison.

This catalog does not replace hardware drivers or infer pins and panel timings.
`sketch.yaml`, compile-time device selection, board metadata and exact-profile
implementation remain firmware concerns. Integration tests check their agreement.

### Browser source units and deterministic assembly

`src/web/admin/bundle.json` lists 51 ordered source units. General editor code
lives under `src/web/admin/`; type-specific behavior lives beside its type under
`src/types/<type>/admin*.js`.

`tools/lib/admin-bundle.mjs` assembles these into the classic script at
`src/web/assets/admin.js`. It checks source coverage, duplicate/invalid paths,
and the syntax of each unit and the assembled result. There is no browser module
loader, additional network request or runtime dependency introduced by this split.

The readable assembly remains checked in. For delivery, the host tooling uses
pinned Terser 5.51.2 with `compress: false` and `mangle: false` to remove ordinary
comments and excess whitespace, retaining selected license/preserve comments.
Identifier names are preserved and optimizer passes remain disabled.
An independent Acorn syntax-tree comparison rejects changes except lexical
locations/raw spelling and equivalent ordinary data-property shorthand. The
formatted output is then gzipped for the firmware; it is not byte-identical to
the readable assembly.

Run `npm ci --ignore-scripts` before host tests or asset generation. These tools
run only on the build computer; firmware and browser need no npm packages.
`tools/generate-web-assets.mjs` writes only changed output, preserving build
caches. Shared browser scope and load order remain dependencies between source
units. Final BIN measurements remain separate from asset-size checks.

### Tile identities, policies and state dispatch

Each type owns its runtime records in `state.h` or `widgets.h`.
`tile_renderer.h` preserves compatibility and owns the aggregate grid cache/API.
`src/types/tile_type.h` owns stable numeric IDs, including retired values.
`src/types/tile_type_policy.h` separates entity persistence, cached state,
popup-mode, MQTT routing/subscription, icon-refresh and screensaver eligibility.
They intentionally differ: Camera stores an entity without consuming ordinary
cached tile state, and Weather uses its own subscription path.

`src/tiles/runtime/tile_update_service.h` owns the live-state service list.
Active budgets remain Sensor 6, Switch 6, Climate 4, Cover 4, Binary Sensor 4,
Weather 4 and Media 2. Sleep passes zero to drain each queue. Compile-time
selection preserves direct calls without a permanent callback table or runtime
registration.

`enqueue_cached_tile_state()` in `tab_tiles_unified.cpp` is shared by full-grid
and single-slot restoration. It retains existing payload fallbacks, sensor unit
resolution and the ability to omit media while building hidden folder caches.
Cache construction, lifecycle resets and type-specific queues are still separate.

### Settings access codec

`src/core/config/settings_access_record.h` separates record encoding/validation
from NVS I/O. The implementation stays local to the calling translation unit.
Legacy, v3 and v4 records remain 60, 132 and 144 bytes with unchanged checksum
coverage. The hash remains authoritative when validating the bounded recovery
PIN copy.

Corrupt parental-control metadata deliberately recovers by revealing and
unlocking Settings. That existing recovery behavior is preserved, not newly
introduced. Record rejection itself leaves the destination unchanged;
ConfigManager owns the recovery decision and subsequent normalization.

### HTTP endpoint decomposition

Under `src/web/server/handlers/`, `web_admin_handlers.cpp` retains settings,
MQTT/Bridge, status, restart and border handlers. Endpoint families now live in
`web_admin_tiles.cpp`,
`web_admin_files.cpp`, `web_admin_diagnostics.cpp`, `web_admin_screensaver.cpp`
and the existing `web_admin_hardware_io.cpp`. OTA handlers and their state now
live together in `web_admin_ota.cpp`.
`src/web/server/web_admin.cpp` retains server lifecycle and route registration.
JSON escaping, JSON errors and case-insensitive suffix checks have one compiled
owner in `web_admin_handler_utils.cpp`, avoiding a copy in each endpoint module.
The private `web_admin_handler_utils.h` retains tiny inline device/storage and
restart wrappers; `web_admin_tile_helpers.h` owns tile-specific shared helpers.
Request fields, response behavior and persistence ordering remain the contract.

## Extending the project

A new device starts with exact hardware evidence and an isolated device profile.
Add its host-tool identity to the catalog, retain exact silicon/transport guards,
then validate generated outputs, source selection and image metadata together.
Shared panel logic is appropriate only where the hardware contract truly matches.

A new tile starts with a persisted ID, explicit policies and a type descriptor.
Its module owns rendering, HTTP field handling and type-specific browser code;
central localization remains shared. Persistence, queue service, hidden caches,
screensaver eligibility and Bridge subscriptions are separate integration points.
The complete end-to-end checklist remains in AGENTS.md; the new helpers reduce
duplication but do not replace that contract.

## Audited risks and unresolved behavior

| Finding | Evidence and practical impact | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| P4 settings write errors can be missed | Non-S3 `BatchedNvsWrite::finish()` returns true; ConfigManager ignores most individual write results. An earlier failed key write can coexist with a reported successful save and updated RAM state. | Verified unchecked error path; fault-injection reproduction and fix pending |
| GitHub OTA does not authenticate TLS certificates | `fetchHttpRange()` uses `setInsecure()`. Device/project/silicon metadata checks image compatibility, not the identity of the download server. | Verified configuration; trust model and size-aware hardening pending |
| MQTT reads live mutable configuration across tasks | The MQTT worker reads `ConfigManager::getConfig()` by reference while the loop can replace that structure during a save. An immutable configuration handoff would clarify ownership. | Unsynchronized access identified; no runtime race reproduced in this review |
| Battery and IMU policy remains a shared stub | `src/core/power/` reports mains/no battery and touch-only wake for all profiles. Capability flags alone cannot implement board telemetry or IMU behavior. | Existing firmware limitation; requires exact-board implementations and validation |
| Queued state can outlive slot bindings | Switch/Binary Sensor guard stale layouts; several other queues retain only grid/slot targets across reset paths. | Inconsistent protection confirmed; failing navigation/rebuild scenario not yet reproduced |
| Idle backlog drains slowly | Active idle service resets its timestamp after one bounded batch every two seconds. A 31-entry sensor backlog needs six service windows, up to roughly 12 seconds. | Scheduling behavior confirmed; latency impact depends on traffic and interaction |
| Image preview work runs within LVGL service | The preview timer calls `process_preview_step()` from its callback. Work is stepped, but individual storage/decode duration still matters. | Call path confirmed; target-device timing required |
| Popup exclusion is distributed | Light, Sensor, Climate and Cover maintain different lists of peer hide calls. | Extension risk; no new overlap failure reproduced in this review |

These findings are not fixed by structural changes. Existing media deletion and
camera buffer protections remain necessary; removing them would undo prior fixes.

## Prioritized next work

1. Reproduce persistence failures and stale-slot delivery with injected errors and
   controlled queue/reset sequences. Fix proven failures with focused tests before
   changing throughput or adding more stateful tile types.
2. Separate media artwork decoding, transport and presentation. Keep widget/cache
   ownership explicit; first preserve the translation unit, then measure any
   proposed separate compilation boundary against firmware size and hot paths.
3. Separate TileConfig's record codecs from filesystem replacement/recovery and
   folder policy. Test interrupted writes, backup promotion and sidecar recovery
   before changing transaction sequencing or persistence layout.
4. Centralize popup exclusion and document each popup's hide/delete semantics.
   Final slider delivery, timer cancellation and entity rebinding remain local
   responsibilities; a shared close function must not silently discard commands.
5. Give browser editor state explicit interfaces after source assembly.
   Start with draft/snapshot/autosave boundaries and run the real preview branches.
6. Separate MQTT session/outbound scheduling from network-interface recovery only
   after worker/loop ownership is executable in tests. Preserve profile-specific
   P4 transport safeguards rather than making them generic defaults.

## Validation and performance acceptance

Host tests establish contracts, not display or network behavior on real hardware.
Install the pinned host dependencies with `npm ci --ignore-scripts` first.
`node tools/run-tests.mjs` recursively discovers `tools/tests/<area>/test-*.mjs`;
optional name fragments select domains or topics without a separate CI test list.
The codec fixtures execute production C++ with platform shims; queue and cached
state tests execute production dispatch with controlled endpoints. Browser tests
exercise editor behavior; asset checks establish deterministic generated bytes.

For this refactoring, both test-device application BINs must be no larger than
their baseline: `waveshare_8` and `guition_esp32_4848s040`. Compare matching source
baselines with the same toolchain, profile, optimization and diagnostic flags.
`tools/compare-firmware-size.mjs` checks image identity and reports byte counts,
SHA256 hashes and deltas. Padded factory images are not a useful size metric.
Final measurements belong in the generated verification report, not an assumed
claim in this guide. A smaller BIN alone does not establish better runtime speed.

| Scenario | Waveshare 8-inch P4 | Guition ESP32-4848S040 S3 | Evidence to collect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Boot and retained MQTT burst | Required | Required | Time to usable UI, missing states, queue drops, minimum internal heap |
| Folder navigation and cached restore | Required | Required | Correct entity/state binding, tap latency, loop gaps, repeated-cycle memory |
| Sensor/Binary Sensor history and unavailable states | Required | Required | Correct localized state, fresh history, missing/zero distinction |
| Light/Climate/Cover interactions | Required | Required | Drag responsiveness, final command, remote echo behavior, repeated open/close |
| Media artwork and rapid track changes | Required | Required | Decode/presentation time, late-result handling, internal/PSRAM headroom |
| Camera open/close and network recovery | Required | Unsupported | FPS, presentation timing, restored UI buffers, no transport teardown race |
| Sleep/wake and screensaver | Required | Required | Current state on wake, touch behavior, brightness and cache correctness |
| Web Admin save/reload and OTA | Required | Required | Persistence after reboot, responsive editing, correct-profile update handling |

Use existing `[LoopGap]`, media/camera timing output and optional Guition
diagnostics for baseline/candidate comparisons. Use the same configuration,
entities, payload sequence and warm-up period. Separate first-use work from warm
cache behavior, repeat interactions, and record worst gaps as well as averages.
Additional instrumentation belongs in an isolated diagnostic build; production
performance work should not add permanent buffers or per-frame logging.
