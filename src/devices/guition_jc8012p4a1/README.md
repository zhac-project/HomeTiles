# Guition JC8012P4A1

This target supports the 10.1-inch Guition JC8012P4A1 family as a 1280x800
landscape HomeTiles display. The physical JD9365 panel is 800x1280; the board
driver rotates HomeTiles' framebuffer into its native portrait orientation.

## Source-verified hardware configuration

- ESP32-P4 application processor, ESP32-C6 Wi-Fi coprocessor, 16MB SPI flash
  and 32MB PSRAM
- two-lane MIPI-DSI at 1500Mbps per lane; 60MHz DPI pixel clock
- native 800x1280 timing: H 20/20/40 and V 4/8/20
- MIPI D-PHY power from on-chip LDO channel 3 at 2500mV
- LCD reset on GPIO 27
- active-high backlight on GPIO 23, LEDC low-speed timer 1, 20kHz, 10-bit
- GSL3680 touch on I2C SDA 7/SCL 8, reset GPIO 22, optional interrupt GPIO 21
- 4-bit microSD on SDMMC slot 0: D0-D3 39-42, CLK 43, CMD 44; power control
  through on-chip LDO channel 4

HomeTiles first tries the 400kHz touch clock used by the reported-working
HomeTiles fork and automatically retries at the 100kHz value used by Guition's
official Arduino rotation example. The clean raw-coordinate path is based on
Espressif's Apache-2.0 GSL3680 driver and is mapped through the exact inverse of
HomeTiles' display rotation.

## HomeTiles integration

- The target and OTA descriptor key are `guition_jc8012p4a1`.
- The 16MB partition table has two 6656KB OTA application slots.
- Display, brightness control, touch, ESP-Hosted Wi-Fi, LittleFS, 4-bit SDMMC
  and local OTA are wired in.
- The ESP-Hosted Wi-Fi link uses the Issue #30 field-validated V1 compatibility
  path: 1-bit SDIO at 40MHz with C6-to-P4 RX reads split into individual
  512-byte CMD53 transfers. This does not apply to JC8012P4A1 V2 or any other
  device profile.
- The live microSD filesystem is used by HomeTiles' file manager, wallpaper
  screensaver and screenshot paths. The existing one-time migration copies only
  legacy `/_tile_grids`, `/_tile_links` and `/icons` data to LittleFS.
- SD mount first uses 40MHz high-speed mode and retries at 20MHz default speed.
- Audio, RTC and battery reporting are not enabled yet.

## Built-in camera

The V1 board carries the same OV02C10 camera as the V2 on connector FPC5;
Guition's V1 `video_lcd_display` demo is the archive the V2 sensor data comes
from. Every build compiles the capture path; the user enables it in Web
Admin Settings. The board file is
`local_camera_board.cpp`; sensor data and open assumptions are in
`src/video/local_camera/sensors/ov02c10/PROVENANCE.md`.

- SCCB 0x36 shares the GSL3680 touch bus (SDA 7, SCL 8); no reset, power-down
  or XCLK pin, so "off" means software standby
- V2 capture mode and mounting defaults; orientation, the fitted module and a
  combined stream plus Web OTA soak on the Issue #30 SDIO path are pending
  hardware checks

The device target has been validated on real hardware through
[HomeTiles issue #5](https://github.com/GalusPeres/HomeTiles/issues/5):
display output, touch direction, MQTT/Bridge communication and automatic
discovery are confirmed working. CI publishes both factory and OTA binaries.
