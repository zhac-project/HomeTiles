// Opt-in still-image service for the built-in camera, shared by every device
// with a camera board file (HOMETILES_LOCAL_CAMERA, see camera_driver.h and
// camera_select.h). On every other profile all functions are inexpensive stubs
// that report "not supported".
//
// Threading:
//   - begin(), setEnabled(), service(), onMqttConnected(), handleMqttMessage(),
//     releaseForSleep() and shutdown() run on the Arduino loop task.
//   - isCommandTopic() may be called from the MQTT worker.
//   - Sensor access, capture, encoding and waiting for the MQTT upload run on a
//     dedicated low-priority worker task that is created on first enable.
//   - A live stream runs its capture loop on that worker and its socket on a
//     second idle-priority sender task (local_camera_upload.cpp).
