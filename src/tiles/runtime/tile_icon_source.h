//          on/off, climate mode, cover state);
//   rules  the color bar and state colors on the entity's state.
// The color can force the icon color (over the type's state color) and tint
// the tile background (tile_tint.h). Tile types that do not apply the fixed
// icon color themselves (Switch, Climate, Cover, Media, Weather) get it
// forced here as well. The Web Admin preview mirrors this in icon-colors.js.
