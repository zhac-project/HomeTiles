// GitHub update: check /releases/latest through its redirect (the Location
// header is sufficient, so no JSON API or API rate limit is involved), then
// download the release asset over HTTPS into the OTA partition.
//
// GitHub release naming contract:
//   Tag:   vX.Y.Z (the same format as FW_VERSION in version.txt)
//   Asset: hometiles_<tag>_<device-key>.bin
//   Example: hometiles_v0.3.2_waveshare_touch_lcd_8.bin
// releaseAssetDeviceKey() derives <device-key> from Device::profile().key
// and the validated silicon variant. Firmware up to v0.2.9 used the
// esp32-p4-homeassistant-display-* schema. install() retains that fallback for
// old devices, but new releases do not need to publish the legacy names.
//
// The repository was renamed from ESP32-P4-HomeAssistant-Display to HomeTiles.
// GitHub permanently redirects the old URL, so older firmware continues to
// work. Never recreate a repository at the old URL because that would break
// the redirect.
//
// ZHAC fork: updates come from the fork's own releases. An upstream image has
// no ZHAC Cloud transport, so installing it would silently cut a cloud panel
// off.
