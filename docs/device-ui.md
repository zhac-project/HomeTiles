# On-Device UI

Tap tiles to control devices, open folders, or view details. Configure the layout in the [Web Admin](web-admin.md).

</figure>

Every icon sits on a round circle, and a tile can take on its icon's color. Tiles and circles use the same corner radius, and half-height tiles show their title and value next to the icon. Colors, circles, and radius are set in the [Web Admin](web-admin.md#global-settings); [rules](web-admin.md#colors-and-rules) can color a tile by the state of an entity. Every tile type and its popup is shown under [Tile Types](tiles.md).

## Folders

Folders have their own grid. The back tile returns to the previous page.

<figcaption>Folder with light tiles and scenes</figcaption>
</figure>

A protected folder asks for its PIN first; see [Folder](tiles.md#folder).

## Popups

For tiles with detail controls, choose a tap or long press as the popup trigger in the Web Admin. Popups take on the look of their tile: the header shows the tile's icon and circle, and most popups use the tile's color.

History popups have **24H** and **7D** views; the previous data stays visible until the new period arrives. To read an earlier value, touch a graph and move your finger along it, or tap an Energy bar. The time and value appear above the graph, and the marker stays where you let go.

Each type's popup is shown with its tile:

| Tile | Popup |
| --- | --- |
| [Sensor](tiles.md#sensor), [Binary Sensor](tiles.md#binary-sensor) | History graph or state timeline with Activity |
| [Number](tiles.md#number), [Select](tiles.md#select), [Date/Time](tiles.md#datetime) | Control above the history |
| [Energy](tiles.md#energy) | Hourly and daily bars |
| [Switch](tiles.md#switch) | Brightness, color, and color temperature for lights; on/off otherwise |
| [Cover](tiles.md#cover) | Position and tilt |
| [Weather](tiles.md#weather), [Media](tiles.md#media), [Climate](tiles.md#climate) | Forecast, playback, temperature and modes |
| [Camera](tiles.md#camera-experimental) | Live video |

Home Assistant can also open a folder or popup using the display's [View Select entity](bridge.md#control-the-displayed-view).

## Built-in Camera Indicator { data-toc-label="Camera indicator" }

While Home Assistant uses the display's own [built-in camera](bridge.md#built-in-camera), a red line runs along the top edge and a **Camera active** pill appears below it. Tap the pill to end the live stream; the camera stays available for the next request. Both parts can be switched off in the [Web Admin](web-admin.md#built-in-camera).

## Settings

The gear tile opens Settings.

</figure>

If Settings is PIN-protected, enter the PIN to open it. If its tile is hidden, swipe inward from the configured screen edge; the swipe also works while the tile is visible. The factory PIN **466384537** also unlocks protected folders; see [Settings access](web-admin.md#settings-tile-and-access).

### Display

Adjust brightness, sleep timeout, screensaver timeout, and screensaver brightness. **Never** disables the corresponding timeout. The rotate button turns the UI by 180°.

</figure>

Tap a **Clock** tile to open the screensaver immediately. See [Screensaver](screensaver.md) for its layout and images.

### WiFi

Select a network and enter its password. The connected network is checked, and its IP address opens the [Web Admin](web-admin.md).

- **Disconnect:** stay offline until you reconnect or restart; saved credentials remain.
- **Enable AP:** connect through the display's hotspot and setup portal.
- **Manual:** enter the SSID and password with the on-screen keyboard.
