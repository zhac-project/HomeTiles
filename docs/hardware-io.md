# Local Hardware I/O

Use up to eight available GPIOs for switches or DS18B20 temperature inputs. These work locally, including when Home Assistant or MQTT is offline.

Open **I/O** in the Web Admin. Assignments belong to the physical panel and are excluded from dashboard exports.

## Switch Outputs

1. Select **+ Switch** and enter a name.
2. Choose an offered GPIO.
3. Set the active **High / Low** level where configurable.
4. Choose the startup state, **Off / On**.
5. Select **Save** to apply the assignment. **Restart** reboots separately and does not save edits.

For the **86-Panel-ETH-2RO**, select **Relay 1** or **Relay 2** explicitly; the shared Waveshare 4B firmware also serves boards without these relays. **On** closes NO-COM, **Off** closes COM-NC, and their active-high polarity is fixed.

Relay-equipped Guition ESP32-4848S040 variants expose their first onboard relay.

## DS18B20 Temperature Inputs { data-toc-label="DS18B20 inputs" }

Select **+ Temperature**, enter a name, choose a GPIO and precision, then save.

Use **one DS18B20 per GPIO**, external sensor power, and a **4.7 kΩ pull-up from data to 3.3 V**. The internal pull-up is disabled. Values are available to local Sensor tiles on the dashboard and screensaver.

## Tiles And Home Assistant { data-toc-label="Tiles & HA" }

After saving, select the local entity in a Switch or Sensor tile on the same panel.

Bridge v0.6.32 or newer also adds it to the panel's Home Assistant device. Outputs become `switch` entities; temperatures become `sensor` entities. Existing names changed manually in Home Assistant are preserved.

## Available Pins

The I/O selector offers only pins assigned for use by that device's firmware profile. Check connected expansion modules for conflicts; some listed profiles still need physical I/O validation.

!!! danger "3.3 V logic only"
    Never connect a relay coil, mains voltage, or another high-current load directly to an ESP32 GPIO. Use a 3.3 V-compatible driver or relay module and follow the manufacturer's schematic. Do not assign a pin already used by an attached module.
