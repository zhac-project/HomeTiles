    Tile edits save as you make them and appear on the display.

## Creating a Tile

<div class="ht-illustrated-intro" markdown>
<div markdown>

1. Click an empty cell.
2. Choose a **Type**.
3. Select an entity where needed and adjust the tile.

Every tile has these settings:

- **Title:** optional label; press **Enter** for a second line. Both lines are centered together, and each line ends in `...` if it exceeds the available width. The display, popup header, and live preview follow the tile's size.
- **Icon (MDI):** a [Material Design Icon](https://pictogrammers.com/library/mdi/) name. **Show icon list** opens the catalog.
- **Icon color:** the icon's color; Reset restores the type's default. **Circle in icon color** tints the circle behind the icon.
- **Tile color:** **Global** uses the [global tile color](#global-settings), **Custom** your own color, and **From icon** tints the tile with the icon color. **Strength** sets how strongly.
- **Column, Row, Width, Height:** grid position and size in half steps.

New tiles with a colorable icon start with **From icon** at 20 %.

See [Tile Types](tiles.md) to choose the right type.

### Type-specific settings { data-toc-label="Type settings" }

<div class="ht-illustrated-intro" markdown>
<div markdown>

Fields depend on the selected type. A numeric Sensor offers:

| Field | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Entity | Sensor to display |
| Unit | Unit label, such as °C or W |
| Decimals | Decimal places |
| Value size | Size of the displayed value |
| Display mode | Text or a gauge with a minimum and maximum |

Number, Select, and Date/Time also offer **Value size** with the same choices as Sensor. In half-height tiles the value uses 20, 24, or 28. Their live values appear in the preview, including after switching folders or selecting another tile. Choose the matching entity and whether a tap or long press opens its popup.

</div>

## Global Settings

The **Global settings** below the preview apply to every tile on the display.

<figure class="ht-screenshot">
<img src="../images/web-admin-global-settings.png" alt="Global settings for tile borders, radius, icon circles and tile color" width="765" height="195" loading="lazy">
<figcaption>Global settings for all tiles</figcaption>
</figure>

| Setting | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **Tile borders** | Draws a thin border around the tiles. Clock, Text, and Back tiles can switch it off individually. |
| **Tile radius** | Corner radius of tiles, popups, and previews. The maximum makes half-height tiles fully round. |
| **Icon circles** | Shows a circle behind every icon. A tile can switch its own circle off. |
| **Circle strength** | Opacity of the icon circles, from 0 to 100 %. |
| **Tile color** | Background of every tile whose tile color is **Global**. |

New displays start with the maximum radius and the tile color `#1A1A1A`.

## Colors and Rules { data-toc-label="Colors and rules" }

Rules change the icon and tile color while an entity has a matching state. Set **Rules** to **On** in the tile settings; a tile with its own entity starts at **Own entity** and **Own rules**:

- **Own entity / Other entity:** follow the tile's own entity or any other entity selected in the Bridge. Scene, Folder, Back, Camera, Clock, and Text tiles have no entity of their own and always use another entity.
- **Entity color:** use the color the entity shows itself: a light's color, heating or cooling on a climate entity, and the state colors of switches, covers, and binary sensors.
- **Own rules:** choose the colors yourself, by value or by state (see below).
- **Color icon / Tint tile:** what the rule colors. **Strength** sets the tint.

While a rule matches, it wins. Otherwise the icon and tile colors above apply. Without a state, for example while Home Assistant is offline, the tile keeps its icon color.

### Icon Color by Value { data-toc-label="By value" }

For Sensor, Energy, and Number tiles: a color bar between **Min** and **Max**. **Smooth** blends the colors, **Steps** changes at each marker. Start from **Cold → Warm**, **Traffic light**, **Battery**, **Humidity**, or **Single color**. Drag a marker to move it, click it to choose its color, and double-click the bar to add one (up to six).

<figure class="ht-screenshot">
<img src="../images/web-admin-rules.png" alt="Rules with a color bar from 15 to 25" width="408" height="784" loading="lazy">
<figcaption>A temperature from blue to red</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

### Icon Color by State { data-toc-label="By state" }

For Sensor, Binary Sensor, Select, and Date/Time tiles: up to six states, each with a color. A row matches the exact state, or any state containing its text when **contains** is ticked; upper and lower case do not matter, and the first match wins. Binary sensors have one color for On and one for Off. Unavailable states keep the default color.

In this example, a waste sensor says when to put the bin out, such as "Put out in 4 days". Its icon turns red while the state contains "today" and green while it contains "4". With **Tile color → From icon**, the circle and the tile follow the icon color.

## Editing Climate Mini-Tiles { data-toc-label="Climate mini-tiles" }

Click a Climate mini-tile in the preview to edit it, or drag it to another slot. The outline shows whether you are selecting the parent tile or a mini-tile.

Choose temperature, humidity, targets, or mode. **Automatic** chooses values supported by the entity. **Target** is the single target temperature; **Heating target** and **Cooling target** are the two limits of devices that keep a range in Heat/Cool mode.

Resizing the parent changes the available slots. Mini-tiles that still fit keep their place; only those without room are hidden until the tile grows again.

<figcaption>Climate tile and mini-tile editor</figcaption>
</figure>

## Moving, Resizing, Copying { data-toc-label="Move, resize, copy" }

- **Move:** drag a tile to another cell.
- **Resize:** drag its edge handles or enter **Width / Height**. Sizes change in half steps. Sensor, Binary Sensor, Energy, Scene, Folder, Back, Clock, Camera, and Settings tiles can also be half a cell high.
- **Copy / Paste:** duplicate a tile, including between folders. Paste onto an empty cell where the copied size fits; Settings and Back tiles cannot be replaced.
- **Delete:** clear a tile back to an empty cell.

## Folders

Choose the **Folder** type to create a sub-page. It appears as a Web Admin tab and includes a back tile. A folder that still contains tiles keeps its type until you empty it; deleting the tile is still possible.

**Delete Folder / Tab** removes the folder and its tiles.

To protect a folder, select its tile, enable **Protect this folder with a PIN**, enter 4–8 digits, and press **Apply PIN**. The display then asks for the PIN before opening the folder. Folder PINs are stored only on that display and are excluded from exports.

A folder tile can also show the state of what is inside. In this example, the **Climate** folder uses **Rules → On** with the climate entity and **Entity color**, **Color icon**, and **Tint tile**: it turns orange while heating and blue while cooling, and a PIN locks it.

<figcaption>Protected folder that takes the color of a climate entity</figcaption>
</figure>

### Back Tile

<div class="ht-illustrated-intro" markdown>
<div markdown>

Select the back tile to change its icon, icon color, circle, and tile color. It can be moved like any tile, made half a cell high, and shown without a border by clearing **Tile borders**. Every folder keeps one back tile.

</div>
<figure class="ht-screenshot ht-editor-detail">
<img src="../images/web-admin-back-tile.png" alt="Back tile settings" width="439" height="978" loading="lazy">
<figcaption>Back tile settings</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

## Settings Tile and Access { data-toc-label="Settings access" }

Select the Settings tile in the **Home** tab to set how Settings opens on the display:

- **PIN protection:** ask for a 4–8 digit PIN before Settings opens.
- **Hide tile:** remove the Settings tile from the Home grid. You can also drag the tile out of the grid into the field below the preview; this hides it and turns on the edge swipe.
- **Open by edge swipe:** open Settings by swiping inward from the chosen **Swipe edge** (left, right, top, or bottom). This also works while the tile is visible.

To show the tile again, drag it from the field below the preview back into a free Home area that fits its saved size. Its size is preserved, including 1×0.5.

<div class="ht-type-shots" markdown>
<figure class="ht-screenshot">

<figcaption>Access settings of the Settings tile</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

The public factory PIN **466384537** unlocks Settings and protected folders. This is a local child lock; the Web Admin has no login protection. PINs are excluded from dashboard exports.

## Screensaver Editor

Open the **Screensaver** tab. Select the background, clock, or a tile to edit it; drag to move and resize.

See the [Screensaver guide](screensaver.md) for images, activation, and available tiles. Its **Tile borders** setting is independent of the global **Tile borders** for the normal dashboard.

## Device Settings

The **Settings** tab contains:

- **Network:** WiFi credentials, connection type on Ethernet-capable devices, and an optional static IP shared by WiFi and Ethernet.
- **MQTT:** broker address, credentials, and topics; normally supplied by [pairing](home-assistant-setup.md).
- **Localization:** language, time zone, and date/time formats.
- **Built-in camera:** on displays with a camera, see below.

<figure class="ht-screenshot">
<img src="../images/web-admin-settings.png" alt="Settings tab with network and MQTT settings" width="1305" height="1218" loading="lazy">
<figcaption>Device settings in the Web Admin</figcaption>
</figure>

Use **Save** for the settings form. **Restart** is a separate action.

### Built-in Camera

Displays with a supported camera show this section. **Allow Home Assistant to use the built-in camera** is off by default. When enabled, the display captures still images or a live stream only while the [HomeTiles Bridge](bridge.md#built-in-camera) requests them.

<figure class="ht-screenshot">
<img src="../images/web-admin-camera.png" alt="Built-in camera settings" width="1218" height="678" loading="lazy">
<figcaption>Built-in camera settings</figcaption>
</figure>

- **Mode:** resolution, frame rate, and JPEG quality of the live stream. Higher values need more bandwidth.
- **Recording indicator:** a red line at the top of the display and a pill to end the stream while the camera is in use.
- **Advanced:** rotation, mirroring, and a red/blue swap for boards whose colors come out swapped.
- **Image:** brightness, contrast, saturation, red and blue balance, and the maximum gain for dark rooms. **Reset** restores the defaults.

## Local Hardware I/O

Open **I/O** to configure outputs, relays, or DS18B20 sensors. Only pins available for the selected device are offered. See [Local Hardware I/O](hardware-io.md) for setup and wiring.

## Import / Export

**Export** saves folders, tiles, and the screensaver layout in one JSON file. It excludes local I/O assignments and PINs. Older files without screensaver data leave the current screensaver unchanged.

!!! warning
    Import replaces the folders, tiles, and screensaver data contained in the file.

## Screenshot & Diagnostics { data-toc-label="Diagnostics" }

- **Create & Download Screenshot:** saves and downloads a JPEG of the current screen; requires microSD.
- **Download crash log:** downloads reset reasons and crash details.
- **Open SD diagnostics:** runs a short write and read test on the microSD card and shows the report.
- **Core dump:** download or delete a stored memory snapshot when one is available.

See [Reporting a crash](faq.md#the-display-crashed-or-restarted-by-itself) for the files and details to include.

## Firmware Update

Check for releases or upload the matching OTA `.bin` in the Firmware section. Follow [Firmware Updates](updating.md) for the steps.
